# cacao Control: Setup and Overview {#page_cacao_Control_Setup_Overview}


---


## 1. GUIs description

The script `aolconf` starts the main GUI, from which all setup and control can be done. The GUI consists of several main screens.

A Typical cacao control screen will include the following panels:

- cacao control GUI (aolconf script)
- alignment GUI (provided by user, system dependent)
- processes status GUI (launched from cacao control GUI)
- DM viewing screen
- AO loop monitoring screen (aolmon script)
- log viewing window
- log entry window
- real-time data logging control/status window

## 2. Commands logs


ALL commands are logged by the script :

	./aolconfscripts/aollog




### Automatically generated internal command log (very detailed)

`aolconf` uses the script `aolconfscripts/aollog` to log commands and status into file `./logdir/<UTDATE>/logging/<LOOPNAME>.log`. A sym link to `aolconf.log` is created for convenience, so the log content can be viewed with:

~~~~
tail -f aolconf.log
~~~~

Inside the bash script, function `aoconflog` is used to call `aolconfscripts/aollog` with the proper loop name, as defined in the main `aolconf` script:

~~~
# internal log - logs EVERYTHING
function aoconflog {
./aolconfscripts/aollog "$LOOPNAME" "$@"
}
~~~




### User-provided UsExternal log (less verbose)


More important commands are logged simultaneously to the internal log and an external log. The user provides the command to externally log commands.

Inside the bash script, function `aoconflogext` is used to call `aolconfscripts/aollog` with the proper loop name, as defined in the main `aolconf` script:

~~~
# external log, use for less verbose log
function aoconflogext {
./aolconfscripts/aollog -e "$LOOPNAME" "$@"
}
~~~






### Interactive user log

To start the interactive log script:

~~~
./aolconfscripts/aollog -i <LOOPNAME> NULL
~~~

Entries will be logged in the `./logdir/<UTDATE>/logging/<LOOPNAME>.log` file (with sym link to `aolconf.log`).

It is also common practice to start a `MISC` log for misc comments, also to be included in the external log:

~~~
./aolconfscripts/aollog -ie MISC NULL
~~~

The corresponding log can be viewed on the local machine :

~~~
tail -f logdir/<UTDATE>/logging/MISC.log
~~~

In the remote machine, entries are logged in the `comments` log.
